# Hangman Game â€“ Python Project 

A console-based Hangman game built in Python, using object-oriented programming and simple turtle graphics for visual feedback. Developed as a first-year Computer Science project to demonstrate class structure, input validation, and basic game logic.

##Features
- Single-player hangman with random word selection
- Tracks correct and incorrect guesses
- Input validation to ensure clean gameplay
- Turtle graphics used to draw parts of the hangman after each incorrect guess
- Tracks total game duration

## Concepts Applied
- Python classes and functions
- Loops, conditionals, and input handling
- Sets and lists for state tracking
- Time module for measuring gameplay duration
- Turtle module for basic visualization

## Files Included
- `FINALHangmanProject`: Main game script
- `README.md`: This file for documentation

## How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3)
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
